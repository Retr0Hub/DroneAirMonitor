## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

Drone Air Monitor is a full-stack application designed to tackle the challenge of localized air pollution monitoring. Traditional monitoring stations are stationary and provide limited coverage. By leveraging a fleet of drones, this project aims to provide dynamic, high-resolution air quality data from various locations and altitudes.

This project consists of:
*   A **web-based dashboard** for real-time visualization and control.
*   A **backend server** to handle data ingestion from drones, user management, and API services.
*   A **communication protocol** for drones to send data securely and efficiently, likely using WebSockets for real-time updates.

### Built With

This project is built with modern technologies to ensure performance and scalability. (You can modify this list based on your actual stack).

*   **Frontend:**
    *   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
    *   [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
    *   [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
*   **Backend:**
    *   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    *   [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
    *   [WebSocket (ws)](https://github.com/websockets/ws)
*   **Database:**
    *   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Map Visualization:** Track drones and view live air quality data (e.g., CO, NO2, PM2.5) on an interactive map.
*   **Historical Data Analysis:** View and export historical data with charts and graphs to identify pollution trends.
*   **Drone Fleet Management:** Register new drones, view drone status (e.g., battery, location), and manage your fleet.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for platform administrators and users.
*   **Responsive Dashboard:** A clean and modern UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

*   Node.js (which includes npm)
*   Git
*   A database instance (e.g., MongoDB) running locally or accessible via a URI.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/DroneAirMonitor.git
    cd DroneAirMonitor
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies**
    The `app` directory seems to contain your backend. Navigate to it and install the NPM packages.
    ```sh
    cd app
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies** (if you have a separate frontend folder)
    ```sh
    # In a new terminal, from the root directory
    cd client # Or your frontend folder name
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in your `app` (backend) directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if it exists) and fill in your configuration details.
    ```env
    # Example .env file in app/
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="a_very_secure_secret_key"
    ```

---

## üîß Usage

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    ```sh
    # From the app/ directory
    npm start
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specified).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server**
    ```sh
    # From the client/ directory
    npm start
    ```
    The application should open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now navigate the application, register as a new user, and start exploring its features. You may need to run a separate script to simulate drone data.
